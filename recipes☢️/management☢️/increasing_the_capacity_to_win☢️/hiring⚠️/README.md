# Scratch
1. I love hiring, it's probably my favorite activity as a HoE. It lets me correct all those mistakes I made hiring the last batch of people...

# Unorganized📋
* Topgrading
    * Curiousity --> pulling on the thread until you unroll it all. 
        * Examples??
    * Readback
        * Feedback for the candidate --> see how they respond
        * Feedback for you: how well did you do? Your 'integration test'
        * Attract: "how YOU will grow HERE"
    * CTO Parag hated my topgrading :)
* Training
    * Wade's hiring docs
