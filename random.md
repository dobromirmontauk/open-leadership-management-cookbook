# Is the universe Analytical or Computational?
* Most of physics has taken an analytical approach. By that I mean that if we can come up with the right set of rules we should be able to explain how everything works. The GUTE (Grand Unified Theory of Everything)
* But perhaps the universe is *computational*. You can come up with rules of the computation, but that doesn't mean you can explain everything with an analytical approach anymore.
* Feedback loops in everything make analysis impossible?
