# Why Recipes?
Leadership & Management is like cooking. Everyone has their own style, and there's no "right" or "wrong" way to do it. We all learn by watching others, tasting their delicious (or not so much...) creations, and combining our favorite discoveries into our own unique dishes. So, since it is like cooking, we should have a Leadership & Management Cookbook! This is my attempt to start it.

A good cookbook does a few things. This is inspired by [Mastering the Art of French Cooking](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Art-French-Cooking-Vol/dp/0375413405/ref=pd_lpo_sccl_3/143-3838692-8843936?pd_rd_w=kCaD4&content-id=amzn1.sym.116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_p=116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_r=K3BWES5N26QFD5JSQ0DF&pd_rd_wg=bV24H&pd_rd_r=7acd5025-4ac0-40a2-b8e5-2a5c75b610ac&pd_rd_i=0375413405&psc=1)
 * Explain some fundamental _properties_ of the ingredients. Beef, tomatoes, salt -- some of these are fundamental across all of cooking.
 * Explore the _techniques_ available to the chef. Searing, grilling, boiling... 
 * Build some simple, reusable recipes as a _toolbox_. Sauces, rubs, bases...
 * Create magical dishes by combining all of the above in interesting ways.
 * Explore variations on the themes.

We'll use a similar structure here. We'll break down our most complex leadership & management recipes into combinations of simpler building blocks. Hopefully as you grow in your career, you'll move up the recipe complexity ladder and feel comfortable trying the hardest ones! And, as an open cookbook, we encourage you to add your own variations, techniques, insights, or entirely new recipes here. The goal of this cookbook is not to be 100% comprehensive; the topic is too vast for that. In many cases, we'll give a few example recipes, and then point at entire chapters or books dedicated to the subject. 

# About this book

## "Leadership" vs "Management"
Both Leadership & Management are fundamentally about changing how people think. Change how they think, and they'll behave differently. Change how they behave, and they'll reach different outcomes. Like the physics equivalents of acceleration, velocity, and position, to reach a certain (x, y, z, t) one must focus on the correct acceleration. To create the necessary outcomes, we must focus on how people think.

*Leadership* and *Management* are not opposites, they are two ends of a spectrum of work that we do to change how people think. On the Leadership side of the spectrum, we are focused on _direction_: how do we need to change how people think so we end up at the best possible outcome? On the Management side of the spectrum, we are focused on _efficiency_: how do we need to change how people think so we get there with the least possible effort (money, time, resources)? Great leaders find inspirational, yet attainable, outcomes for the team. Great managers make getting there look easy. Those that can do both create a dynamic organization that fluidly navigates the unexpected challenges every ambitious team encounters.

## Audience: Engineering
All of the recipes in this cookbook are built assuming that the cook is a _software engineering_ leader & manager. That doesn't mean that the recipes can't be altered to fit a different palate; like a type of cuisine, many of them can be adopted whole-sale, while others might be usable with minor modifications. Some may not work at all.
