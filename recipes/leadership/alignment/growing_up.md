# Growing Up
A startup's purpose is to provide value in the world & continue to scale up so it can increase the value it provides.

This is the same purpose that any child has. For them, we call it 'growing up'. I think if we apply a similar mental model to startups it helps us understand the *phases of development* that must be tackled.

# Engineering Maturity Model

# Where is Your Company/Organization/Team? Where Should it Be?



# Scratch
* Asia: 'why shouldn't a startup hire people for big salaries' --> my analogy of a child not being able to carry 50LB bag. A startup cannot carry a $500K salary.
* A startup needs to *eventually* be able to take care of all its employees, *eventually* have space for all sorts of individuals... but it doesn't start that way. 
** Hot Take: diversity & inclusion. Perhaps a startup cannot afford to do this in the beginning. It should not be judged by *can it do it today*, it should be judged by *is it growing up in the right way?*
* What is growing up? There are the beliefs we have, and the roll out of those beliefs. We may believe certain things (e.g. we should have diverse teams) but not roll them out -- yet. 
* Everything is a tradeoff between surviving and growing up. Wrong trade off if you die; then you have failed your purpose.
* Every company eventually fails in its purpose; every company eventually disappears. How do we think about that?
* As engineering leaders, what are the dimensions of growing up that we need to carefully consider?
** The Engineering Maturity Model
*** Quality
***** Testing etc --> Quality Maturity Model
*** Cost (of system) --> Cost Maturity Model
*** Efficiency (i.e. cost of people)
*** Reliability
***** SRE book examples!
*** Accuracy
*** Speed (wall time to delivery)
* Applies to companies/organizations/teams -- may need to have different maturity models across different areas.
** Kids have the same thing -- different parts they have different maturity.
* Use the "star" pattern graph to map where you are vs where you should be
