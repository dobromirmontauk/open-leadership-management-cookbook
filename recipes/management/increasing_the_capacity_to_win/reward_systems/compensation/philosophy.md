# Compensation Philosophy
 Compensation 'philosophy' is the misnomer for how your company thinks about paying its employees. Philosophy usually refers to the study of truths, the search for right and wrong, or the seeking of the meaning of life. We doubt such deep first principles thinking influenced your compensation structure. At best, your CEO [cargo-culted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) the comp approach from one of his college buddy's startups.

At worst, he secretely wishes engineers just worked for ~~peanuts~~, I mean stock options.
 
Since a slight gap might exist between your recommendations and your boss's desires, you might find yourself needing to spend some time bridging it so you can get back to the business of hiring engineers and building cooler things than comp spreadsheets. Feel free to start with that 5-minute unprepared conversation in your next 1:1 you were planning on having. Then, come back here for some recipes that might actually work.

# Recipes
Compensation philosophy is very well-written about now so a simple Google search will give you tons of resources. For example, a good set of links are available at [OysterHR](https://www.oysterhr.com/library/14-compensation-philosophy-examples-to-guide-your-global-pay-decisions). We'll focus our recipes on some of the less obvious approaches. 

## The Early Startup Compensation Philosophy Recipe
When you are very small, like <10 people or $1-2M in capital, the compensation philosophy is very simple: "don't go bankrupt." Every hire you make brings you closer to bankruptcy. So the simplest recipe is the following:

"We don't have a compensation philosophy because we are too busy proving that our product is useful to someone. When we've done that and have raised a Series A, we'll reconsider this position. In the mean time, please remember that every raise we give you or other individual we hire shortens our runway, so IT MUST also come with a significant acceleration of product/market fit risk reduction."

Then, do everything in a case-by-case basis. Take on the [Management Debt](/tools/management_debt.md) for now.

## Dobromir's Comp Philosophy Recipe
Congratulations, you survived to Series A (at least). It might be time to pay off some of that management debt you accrued around compensation philosophy. The trick, like in all startup moments, is to do the _least work_ that gives you the outcome you need. If you survive to Series B or later, you'll always have a chance to come clean this up. If you don't... then it doesn't matter anyhow.

The recipe roughly follows this format. I'll have more details in the sections below. 

1. Start with identifiying the problems (a version of [Working Backwards](/tools/working_backwards.md)). 
    1. What problems with comp are _slowing down the business_? What problems are just irking you? 
1. Ask the [Right Questions](/tools/right_question.md)
    1. What is _simplest way_ to solve those problems? What is the debt you are taking on if you do that?
1. Create a [Pressure Test](/tools/pressure_test.md)
    1. What are the _effects on the budget_ if you adopt this proposal? How much are you cutting your runway? Is it worth it?
1. Write up a [Proposal](/tools/written_proposal.md).
    1. Can you express your pros & cons in an unbiased way? 
1. Get buy-in from stakeholdes (CEO)
1. Roll out to your team.
    1. Otherwise, the philosophy isn't real. This is the hardest part!

### Identifying the Problem
Life isn't fair!

### Asking the Right Question
1. What is the maximum the company can afford? 
1. What is the minimum we pay employees? 50% of market? 25%?
1. What is the maximum? 50%? 75%? 90%?
1. BANDS:
    1. Startups: You want to pay the minimum you can get away with. Extends the runway.
    
1. Do we break the bands? If so, when/how?
1. How do we want bands to overlap across levels?
    1. This is important re: promotions.
1. How do we pay ICs vs managers?
1. Do we have levels?
1. Cash/equity balance?
1. Planned Bonuses?
1. Unplanned bonuses?
    1. Yearly?
    1. Ad-hoc?
1. What is the value of the equity?
    1. Founders are thinking of a $10B company... so the equity is HUGE! They have to think this way.
1. Vesting schedule
1. Vacation / PTO / etc
    1. Startups are doing UNLIMITED because that avoids debt on their books (!!)
1. How often do we change our bands? 


# Unorganized
-Different job families should have different philosophies. No reason to pay your Ops team crazy equity. Or some of your FE roles may not be that important?


Pay everyone top dollar --> cuts the company runway + dillutes equity a ton.
Pay everyone top equity, low $ --> unable to hire some of the talent you need (only high-risk people), especially senior folks (more likely to have families/other obligations).

No philosophy --> might be right in the beginning. "Do whatever it takes" --> management debt.
