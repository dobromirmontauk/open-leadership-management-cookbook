# Compensation

Compensation refers to the various forms of monetary or eventually-monetary rewards we give our employees. This
includes, but is not limited to:

1. Salaries: predetermined, predictable cash.
1. Bonuses: unpredictable cash.
1. Equity (Restricted Stock Units, Profit Participation Units, ...): pieces of paper that easily turn into cash (there
   is a market for them).
1. Options to purchase equity (Incentive Stock Options / Nonqualified Stock Options): pieces of paper that don't easily
   turn into cash (no market / may never be a marktet).

It's both a broad and deep topic... meaning there
are [entire Finance departments devoted to figuring this out](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=compensation&origin=SWITCH_SEARCH_VERTICAL&sid=VHK).
If you are visiting this page, my guess is you _don't have_ someone responsible for it at your company, and someone
asked you to drive it. Good luck... We hope some of the recipes here are useful!

## Getting Help

We've spent more hours creating comp planning tools than we'd care to admit. Fortunately, the industry is maturing here
and you can just buy tools off-the-shelf in some cases -- we'll link to them. They might be very expensive though, and
you'll find yourself doing spreadsheets so you can hire that extra engineer... or just because the tools never off all
the features you want.

One #protip: ask your CEO if you can get help from a VC partner. The big firms (_I've checked Greylock/a16z --
Dobromir_) have in-house compensation experts who can help you navigate the space. Avoid reinventing the wheel. You have
better things to do.
