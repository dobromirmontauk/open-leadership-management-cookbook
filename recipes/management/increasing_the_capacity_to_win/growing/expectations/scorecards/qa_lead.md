# QA Lead Scorecard

The QA Lead is responsible for ensuring that the Product Engineering team can efficiently release quality features to customers. This focus on quality is applied at multiple steps in the development process, but should always be implemented in a way that helps empower Engineers to deliver quality features faster.

A QA Lead is a critical hire for a startup. There are many ways for QA Leads to create the wrong "quality culture" that fails to accomplish the goal above. Common pitfalls include:

 Being an order taker. The QA job is to ensure a high-quality product. That does NOT mean doing all the work themselves. QA should be creating a culture of quality by putting in processes & education that ensure every engineer is also taking quality seriously.
 Saying 'no' to everything. QA should help engineering ship _faster_ not slower. The right question to ask is "what is the minimum work we can do to ensure this feature meets the right quality bar?"

## How to use this scorecard

To get the most out of this document you should score yourself on each item, and give yourself a min/max/average on each dimension. Then, ask your manager to do the same \- and maybe peers too. See if they grade you close to how you grade yourself. The goal is to help you go through the [learning cycle](https://web.archive.org/web/10180817212110/http://www.cala.fsu.edu/modules/assessing\_knowledge): ignorance → declarative → procedural → mastery.

Make a copy of this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PX61irzc6eCxgl1tzEzE6aKF92l7EoHcVac7Nb1Beko/edit\#gid=0) and use the following rating scale:

1. You’re not doing this and aren’t likely to in the next 6 months.  
2. You have significant areas where you need to improve.  
3. You do this well.  
4. You do this amazingly — keep it up.  
5. OMG how do you do this so well???

  ## How your manager judges you:
1. Quality: Quality you can taste®
   1. You have a unreasonably high bar of what constitutes a "great" user experience. You are never (quite) satisfied with the state of the features being released. You can easily rattle off a dozen things wrong with any product you regularly use.
   1. You intimitely understand how the product(s) you own work actually work. You understand the nuances of historical design tradeoffs (especially why they made sense at the time). You understand the inputs and outputs, which lets you reason through complex scenarios to predict how the product might fail with the upcoming changes. You think of test cases that nobody else can come up with.
   1. You can think beyond the current product to the problem that the user is facing, and imagine better solutions than what PM/Eng are proposing. You are curious about decisions made and feel empowered to challenge them if you have something better. You contribute to PRDs and TDDs with feedback.
   1. You are obsessed with make sure every release meets a reasonable bar for quality -- which you realize might be lower than your unreasonably high bar. You are always the Voice for Quality, but you are able to listen to others too.
   1. You have experience improving hardware **and** software quality. The intersection of the two is especially interesting to you, and you understand the dynamics of how one affects the other. 
1. Execution/Process: you ensure that QA runs smoothly *this week*.
   1. You make sure test plans are run on time, spending ~50% of your time doing manual testing. You don't shy away from going above & beyond to help the team ship on time. You are incredibly efficient when testing to minimize time while maximizing coverage. 
   1. You are aware of every change going into the product and ensure that quality is covered on every change (delegation is encouraged\!). 
   1. You consider risk factors and effectively prioritize test efforts accordingly. You don't waste time testing low-value scenarios. You put in **extra** effort on the high-risk changes to be very confident customers won't run into issues.
   1. You define a simple, yet effective, QA process with input from your stakeholders. You ensure everyone is following it and use carrots/sticks appropriately to ensure the process runs smoothly. 
   1. You communicate good news quickly and bad news even quicker. Your stakeholders (engineers, PMs, sometimes execs) understand the current blockers, possible risks of pushing forward, and your teams' ability to control quality.
1. Speed: your presence makes engineering faster, not slower.
   1. You plug into the various development processes of different teams smoothly, from product definition to daily standups to actual releases. You don't require them to conform to your style.
   1. You use your expertise proactively to help the organization improve designs and avoid expensive mistakes. You frequently improve the PRD/TDD with your expertise, saving effort in the dev cycle.
   1. You maximize the likelihood of bug-free code by developing test plans with engineering early in the development cycle.  
   1. Product Managers, Designers, and Engineers alike all love working with you because your work helps them be successful.  
   1. You realize that a feature not shipped provides zero value to customers. You are able to compromise intelligently with PM + Eng to maximize the impact of our combined teams. 
1. Constant improvement: you ensure that QA runs even more smoothly *next week*.
   1. You are constantly iterating on how we do testing. You are improving tests, the tools we use, and are working with engineers to automate as much as reasonable. You have a 6-month roadmap of improvements that can be made to QA and regularly making progress on it.
   1. You use data and metrics to measure the effectiveness of testing efforts and optimize efforts to improve over time. You hold yourself and the team accountable to improving these metrics.
   1. You manage up effectively. You are high signal-to-noise and escalate when appropriate: bad technical decisions, poor work quality, inappropriate workload, unreasonable technical debt, etc. You help leadership make better decisions on staffing and prioritization.
   1. 
1. Leadership: you are able to scale yourself + QA through others.
   1. You get buy-in from the engineers, EM/PM, and peers for your QA vision. It aligns well with the company needs, priorities, and appetite.  
   1. The other QA team members look up to you and learn from you. They love working with you and improving in their craft.  
   1. You are an amazing teacher. Instead of just doing testing yourself you empower engineers to test their own work effectively. You teach them best practices and motivate them to *want* to build high quality experiences.
   1. You are an effective partner to your EM for building a tribe: the team has fun, loves what they do, and may be friends forever. 
   1. You are able to identify great QA talent (especially junior), attract them to the company, mentor them, and divide work efficiently.
