# Coding Skills
Software ultimately comes down to writing code. It may be the last thing you want to do (avoid the Not Invented Here syndrome!), but at some point, if you aren't writing code, you're not a software engineer. As you grow in your career your ability to *read and write code* needs to continually improve. This table should give you a rough sense of what we expect at various levels.

| Correctness              | Solves acadamic problems correctly but needs hand-holding to solve real-world problems correctly. Can talk about performance theoretically. | Can solve some real-world problems correctly with no hand-holding; requires extensive hand-holding when problem spans multiple classes or systems. Frequently unaware of performance problems. | Can solve almost all real-world problems correctly; may need hand-holding for complex problems spanning multiple code bases or systems. Performance of code may be occasionally poor.  | Can solve all real-world problems correctly. Regularly catches correctness problems via code reviews. almost always gets performance considerations right.                                                          | Can solve all real-world problems correctly while also anticipating problems that might arise in the future. Regularly suggests edge-case improvements in code reviews.                                   |
| Readability              | Basic concepts around readability like documentation, variable naming, etc.                                                                 | Able to follow a language style guide. Readability tends to be poor due to long methods, unclear signatures, catch-all classes, and unorganized file layout.                                   | Good readability at a single class level. Methods and classes are appropriately focused and documented. Can apply the language style guide in code reviews.                            | Excellent readability at a single-file level (hard to suggest improvements) and solid across classes. Regularly suggests code reorganization across files to keep the entire codebase well-factored.                | Can keep code organized across >100KLoC so an entire codebase is readable. Regularly teaches and enforces readability concepts.                                                                           |
| Reusability              | No real-world understanding of reusability.                                                                                                 | Can apply OOP, composition, and DI when requested but doesn't pro-actively use these patterns.                                                                                                 | Proactively structures code to be reusable when writing new pieces but does not understand the first-principles behind reusability and doesn't enforce them across a larger code base. | Familiar with OOP design patterns, composition design patterns, standard DI tools/techniques, MVC, etc. Can explain reusability concepts and regularly teaches individuals on the code they are most familiar with. | Expert in reusability and regularly up-levels team members via mentorship. Enforces reusable software across their codebase and tangential codebases.                                                     |
| Testability              | Understands unit testing.                                                                                                                   | Can implement decent unit test, integration tests, etc in existing frameworks.                                                                                                                 | Can copy existing testing approaches into a new system (unit test frameworks, etc). Tests are well-factored and easy to follow.                                                        | Can propose new testing strategies that fit the problem at hand (smoke tests, performance tests, etc). Tests are very reliable and thorough.                                                                        | Understands the entire universe of testing all the way through QA and what should be used when. Mentors the team and creates new testing frameworks and processes to improve the quality of the software. |


# TODO
* We should add "Performance" to this
  * E.g. real-world performance is difference than theoretical performance.
