# Senior Software Engineer Career Archetypes

## Introduction

So you're looking to level up to Senior Engineer? Great! But here's the thing: there's no single "Senior Engineer" mold. Different engineers reach Senior through different paths, emphasizing different strengths and making impact in different ways.

This guide presents a few common archetypes (think of them as "character classes" for your engineering career). These aren't rigid boxes you must fit into; most successful Senior engineers blend elements from multiple archetypes or shift between them over time. The goal is to help you identify which paths resonate with your natural strengths and interests.

**Important**: All paths to Senior still require baseline competency in our core engineering dimensions:

- [Domain Skills](dobromir_domain_ladder.md): understanding the problem space deeply
- [Architecture Skills](dobromir_architecture_ladder.md): designing systems wisely
- [Coding Skills](dobromir_coding_ladder.md): writing excellent code

These archetypes describe _how you apply_ those skills and _where you focus_ your energy as you grow.

## The Product Engineer

_"I already shipped it"_

The Product Engineer is obsessed with customer impact and moving fast. They ship features quickly, understand the product deeply, work seamlessly with PMs and designers, and make pragmatic technical decisions that prioritize delivering value. Critically, they know when to push back on scope and when to compromise on their own high technical bar. They're strategic about where quality matters most and where "good enough" unblocks learning. If you get energized by seeing users benefit from your work, this might be your path.

### Core Competencies

- **Strategic Compromise**: Knows when to hold the line on quality vs. when to ship imperfectly to learn faster
- **User Empathy**: Thinks from the user's perspective when making technical decisions

### Key Activities

- Shipping high-impact features on or ahead of schedule
- Participating in product planning and roadmap discussions
- Talking to customers or reviewing user behavior regularly
- Making smart scope decisions to deliver value faster
- Choosing appropriate technical solutions based on product needs
- Running experiments and A/B tests to validate hypotheses

### Growth Path to Senior

**Early signals**: You can implement features fast. You're starting to ask "why" questions about requirements. You meet deadlines with occasional help.

**Senior-level expectations**: You need to demonstrate strong product partnership:

- Consistently ship high-quality features on time
- Proactively identify product edge cases and improvements during planning
- Influence product decisions with technical insights and data
- Work independently with PM/Design with minimal engineering oversight needed
- Make sound judgment calls on technical trade-offs: push back when cutting corners would hurt users, compromise when perfectionism would delay learning
- Track record of shipped features that measurably improved key metrics

### Examples of Impact

- "Shipped 15 features in 6 months with 95% on-time delivery rate"
- "Proposed and built feature that increased user engagement by 25%"
- "Pushed back on shipping payment flow without proper error handling, preventing revenue loss -- but separately advocated for simpler MVP on low-risk feature that shipped 3 weeks earlier"
- "Identified critical edge case during planning that would have impacted 10% of users"
- "Reduced feature complexity by 50% by proposing alternative approach that delivered same user value"

## The Architect

_"Measure twice, cut once"_

The Architect thinks in systems. They excel at both architecture (how components fit together across a codebase or organization) and system design (how to structure individual features or services). They create technical strategy, prevent problems before they happen, and thrive in ambiguity. They break down complex problems into elegant solutions. Crucially, they know how to get buy-in. They surface concerns early, actively mine for disagreement, and build consensus around technical decisions. If you love drawing diagrams and thinking about how pieces fit together, this path is for you.

### Core Competencies

- **System Design**: Creates clear, scalable architectures for complex problems
- **Technical Strategy**: Plans multiple steps ahead and anticipates future needs
- **Abstraction**: Identifies the right boundaries and interfaces between components
- **Technical Writing**: Documents designs thoroughly and clearly
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential problems and mitigates them early
- **Building Consensus**: Gets buy-in from stakeholders; actively mines for conflict and concerns to address them early

### Key Activities

- Writing technical design documents for major features and system designs
- Leading architecture and system design discussions and reviews
- Actively soliciting feedback on proposed designs
- Building consensus across teams on technical direction
- Refactoring systems to improve maintainability and scalability
- Evaluating new technologies and making recommendations
- Preventing technical debt through thoughtful upfront design
- Planning for scale before it becomes a problem

### Growth Path to Senior

**Early signals**: You have strong technical opinions but can work within existing architectures and make incremental improvements. You're writing design docs for improving the whole system alongside the features you are building. You have big ideas for how systems should be built and the conviction to advocate for them.

**Senior-level expectations**: You need to demonstrate architectural leadership while building consensus:

- Design and execute at least 2-3 significant architectural improvements or new systems
- Write clear, thorough design docs that others can easily understand and implement
- Get buy-in on technical decisions by actively seeking out concerns, addressing disagreements, and building consensus before implementation
- Successfully predict and mitigate scaling or maintenance issues before they impact users
- Make sound technical decisions that balance trade-offs (speed vs. flexibility, cost vs. features)
- Influence team/company technical direction through well-reasoned proposals

### Examples of Impact

- "Designed and led migration to microservices that reduced deployment time by 70%"
- "Identified scaling bottleneck 6 months before it became critical and proposed solution that handled 10x growth"
- "Created reusable component library that reduced feature development time by 30%"
- "Wrote design doc for payment system overhaul; ran 5 review sessions to gather feedback, addressed all objections, achieved buy-in from 4 teams and shipped successfully"
