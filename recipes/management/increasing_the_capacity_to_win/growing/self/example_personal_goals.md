# The Background

I started my path towards VP of Engineering at a hot Silicon Valley startup in 2014 by leaving Google. I knew then that someday I wanted to be responsible for building a great engineering culture. The path to get to that “someday” was unclear to me so I set out to find a mentor that could guide me. Incredibly, I ran into the great [Wade Chambers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wadechambers/) who committed to helping me achieve my goal [over 5 years](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fA9nObYf29d-FLE9jwIFm2JTOK8G4m4Z/view?usp=sharing). 

Wade’s mentorship at TellApart and through the Twitter acquisition helped me grow my management and leadership skills such that I ended up leading Twitter’s Videos Ads team, later the Revenue Platform team (~50 engineers after doubling in 9 months), and founding Twitter’s Engineering Leadership program (TWIG). Each effort had company-level impact on revenue and culture. Wade called my style “transformational leadership” and pointed out that I would make waves wherever I went - both good and bad.

As part of TWIG I got heavy exposure to the coaching world. We worked very closely with [Brian Robinson and Yvonne Ellison-Sandler](https://glaconsulting.net/our-team/) to develop the program and coach high-potential Twitter engineers. I spent hundreds of hours facilitating and observing them facilitating group sessions. Eventually I got a personal coach ([Stephanie Soler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/solerassociates/)) to help me transition into the Director-level role on Revenue Platform. Through these interactions I picked up a lot of tools, techniques, and insights into my strengths and weaknesses.

Frankly, I struggled at Twitter as a mid-level manager. I had little patience for the consensus building required to drive long-term change. While I admired those who did it well it simply did not come to me naturally and made me frustrated and unhappy with my job which reflected in my performance. Wade (no longer at Twitter) advised me that someday I must learn to lead during calm and not just during the storm, and at bigger companies with consensus not just smaller efforts via sheer effort of will. He also advised me that I had a long career ahead of me and maybe could learn that in the future :)

This helped me realize that I could immediately help a rocketship company take off and work on my personal issues in parallel to be ready for the “peace” phase. I put together [search criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hSceAuwvtLqWUntYWSDOkVXLmNzYagxL6euq0mgw80U/edit#heading=h.yjmc1y240l4q) and landed at Doxel (long story). While the company was smaller than I was hoping for (6 eng, &lt;$1M in revenue whereas I was looking for ~20 eng, just pre-Series B) it met the criteria spot-on and I used that rubric to say YES.

At Doxel I shelved a lot of the skills I had learned at Twitter. It took me about 6 months to realize: we need to _win today_, not _build for the future_. I even went back to writing code and doing system design, acting as a Tech Lead/Manager and not a Director of Engineering. It didn’t bother me much because I was very aligned with the company but I worried that my hiring, team building, leadership, strategic, and cultural skills would rust. Now that we raised a Series B and are growing to ~80 people (40 in eng) I want to bring those skills back and start working on the next set of skills needed to keep up with company growth and earn the VP of Engineering role.


# The 5 Year Goals

My [overall mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hSceAuwvtLqWUntYWSDOkVXLmNzYagxL6euq0mgw80U/edit#) is to “use technology to remove the obstacles preventing human minds from focusing on civilization’s _hardest_ problems.” I’m well-aligned with Doxel’s long-term mission to automate a large part of construction monitoring and progress tracking across several dimensions. Ideally, I can use Doxel as a platform for my mission over the next 5 years while Doxel can use me to accomplish its mission. As such, I’d like to keep _maximum leverage at the company_ which means graduating into the VP of Engineering role and winning. The title is not important; it’s about the skills, scope, and achievement:



* Skills
    * Learn to performance-manage a large (100+) organization
        * Identify issues early even when 3-steps removed (Dir/EM/individual)
        * Tell the difference between “good” and “great” execution at org level (20-40 people)
        * Build a toolbox I can use to causally change org performance
    * Become a world-class technology business strategist
        * Understand finance, marketing, sales, etc world well-enough to incorporate their needs into my engineering/technology thinking early
        * Developer deep understanding of our technology space (construction + computer vision + machine learning) to spot good ideas or dangerous competitors early
    * Become a world-class negotiator
        * Get 80% as good as world-class recruiters at closing talent by deeply understanding their decision-making process.
        * Get 80% as good as world-class biz dev people at finding partnerships (companies/people) and getting their help in achieving our goals
    * Improve my ability to influence
        * Learn how CEOs think, what’s important to them, and how I can influence them on the right subjects/right moment to improve Doxel’s outcomes
        * Learn how Sales/Marketing/peer team thinks, and do the same as above
        * Maybe the same for cofounders (if different from CEO)
        * Learn how to provide value at the Board level
    * Learn to grow senior leaders (Director/Principal+)
* Achievements
    * Build a world-class engineering organization
        * Well recognized via world-of-mouth, high-quality publications (from blog posts to actual papers), ease of recruitment.
        * Very high retention rate (90%?)
        * Ability to solve “technological edge” problems as first-in-the-world
    * Propel Doxel towards a $10B company
        * Build a significant technological competitive advantage over the industry
        * Use our technology story effectively in brand, marketing, sales, etc.
        * Build all the foundations needed to be a world-class enterprise SaaS solution
    * Work with Robin & Saurabh for the next 5-10 years and grow Doxel’s engineering team globally.
    * Build an amazing company leadership culture from CEO Staff level all the way down, beyond just Engineering organization. Have my fingers in the cultural pie. 


# The Work

A lot of The Work is skills development but even more of it as I grow as a leader is internal adjustments to earn the position and responsibility. Skills I’ll be able to pick up ad-hoc with practice/mentorship. The internal work should probably be called out early since it will take longer and may need more focus.

Personal things I want to work on that affect my professional output/impact. These are brief and we can discuss in 1:1.



* Impatience
* Trust issues
    * Exhibits itself as becoming emotional.
* Judgmentalism & harshness
* Favoritism (perceived even if I don’t think it’s there)
* Not listening well
* Not being approachable


# The Coach

I’d like a coach that has two major qualifications:



1. “Done the job”. Ideally, my coach has been in the VP of Engineering role or is incredibly familiar with it and can help me see my blindspots on skills/techniques/etc. I’ve had coaches who haven’t done the role and eventually the coaching felt a little too surface-level. I’ll probably need very specific directions at certain times (“go audit your organization using this technique”) and not general leadership principles.
2. “Part therapist”. Ideally, my coach can dive into the therapy side of The Work lightly. If I need a deeper therapy expert I can also go in that direction although I’d like to be able to tie the two together a least a little since at these levels of leadership they cannot be separated.
