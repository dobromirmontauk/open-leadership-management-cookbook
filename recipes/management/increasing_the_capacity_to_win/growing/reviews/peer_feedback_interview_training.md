There are two purposes to our review process:

1. Determine the *level* at which our employees are performing, so we can reward them appropriately – including firing them, if necessary.  
2. Increase their *performance* going forward through positive feedback (encouragement\!) and improvement feedback (growth\!).

The 360 review process, where we get feedback from peers / direct reports / others across the organization, is designed to find the *patterns* in their performance. Patterns solve a few problems:

1. Avoid *bias*, especially at the manager level, where a small set of data might create a strong (but wrong\!) impression.  
2. Uncover the *top* strengths and growth needs. There are an infinite number of things someone can improve at. If multiple people call it out, it probably matters.  
3. Be *motivational*. Humans are social creatures; hearing similar praise (or criticism\!) from multiple peers is much more convincing than a single opinion. It’s hard to ignore 5 people saying the same thing\!

So how do you uncover the patterns? We use an *interview format* to make gathering feedback & finding patterns efficient. I’ve learned that it takes a lot less time and leads to higher quality feedback, compared to asking folks to write their feedback down. But it takes extra skill on the part of the interviewer; the quality of the output is largely based on the quality of your input. Here are few pointers to get you started:

1. Come in with curiosity → be a truth seeker  
2. Dig, dig, dig. Most statements require followup questions to really get to what reviewers mean.  
3. People *always* tell the truth – if you ask the right questions. If you are not learning what you need, that’s on you.  
4. Read back what you heard for confirmation bias.   
5. Take live notes. DO NOT record; it makes it too uncomfortable. Learn to type fast.  
6. Provide contrasts: exaggerate what you heard to see how much they *walk back* your statements.

My rough outline for interviews:

# Opening

The goal of the opening is to get the reviewer (and yourself\!) comfortable & open to feedback. The best way is to start *unprescriptive* – “choose your own adventure”. My favorite question is:

“Describe this individual as if I had never met them. If we’re hanging out and having beers, how would you describe your coworker?”

The open-ended nature of the question serves two purposes:

* It puts me in a curiosity mode: I try to drop all my preconceptions and pretend I don’t know the person we are talking about.  
* Most reviewers do a “first association” – *something* will jump out to them. “They are curious”, “they are fast”, etc. This is often the high-order bit: a personality trait that defines a lot of the rest of their performance.

You need to do a LOT of follow up in the opening. Use:

* Can you give me an example of that?  
* In what situations have you seen this?  
* What do you mean when you say “X”?

However, it can be hit or miss. Mine if there gold; if not, move on.

# Expectations

For certain roles it is good to clarify expectations. The goal here is to solidify *in the reviewer’s mind* what “good” vs “great” looks like, so the rest of their feedback is anchored and not wishy-washy.

Start with defining *responsibility:*

* What is her role at the company?  
* What areas does this individual own?  
* Are they the go-to expert for any part of the system?

Then ask about *success*: 

* What does success look like for this person in the next 6 months?

I usually also ask for a ranking at this point, to transition to strengths/areas for improvement:

* What score would you give her right now, on a 1-10 scale? 10 is the best person you can imagine doing this job.

People almost always give 7-9 range. 5 or 6 tends to be bad. 7-8 is meets expectations; 9 is probably exceeds. I always follow up this question with:

* Why not a \+1 or \+2 \[if 7, an 8 or 9\]? What would they need to be doing, right now, to get the higher score?  
* Why not a \-1 or \-2? 

# Strengths

You are probably starting to already see some strengths from the line of questioning above. The questions here start to be less prescriptive and more following-up on threads you heard earlier. They also depend a lot on level. E.g. a junior engineer may not have anything that they are “better at than anyone else” → it doesn’t make sense to ask that question. A Staff engineer definitely should have something\! 

For engineers in particular you should know what projects they have done → you can use those to pull out strengths. 

* What are they better at than anyone else at the company / the team?  
* Where are they exceeding your expectations / where are they shining?  
* What did they do particularly well on Project X?

If you already have a sense of their strengths, get more examples:

* You mentioned they have good code quality. What changes did they make recently where they demonstrated this? What code review comments were you impressed by?  
* Etc

# Areas for Improvement

This is often the hardest part because most people are wired against giving feedback that could come across as critical. Framing questions in terms of opportunities / future growth / etc can help avoid the feeling of “I’m judging them right now.” However, you will likely need to do dig \+ exaggerate here to really get some meat.

Example starter questions:

* What would you like to see them do differently in the next 90 days?  
* What would you like to see her start or stop doing in the next 90 days?  
* What would you like to see more of? Less of? 

People rarely lie, and if you are not hearing what you need, it’s because you are not asking direct enough questions. Push against the boundaries:

* Are they the strongest person on the team? The weakest person?  
* You said they needed to improve on X. Do you think they actually can?   
* What kind of project would prove to you that they cannot do X?  
* How would you compare Joe vs X in this skill set?   
* What would be the impact to the team if they left?

## Use Score Cards / Ladder Expectations

Score cards \+ ladders are a great tool for directed growth because they clearly outline expectations at various levels. Some roles already have score cards (e.g. QA); as we mature, more roles / levels will be well-described. Feel free to copy from my historical score cards [here](https://github.com/dobromirmontauk/open-leadership-management-cookbook/tree/main/recipes/management/increasing_the_capacity_to_win/growing/expectations/scorecards) and put your own together.

Similarly, certain engineering positions have pretty standard expectations. My historical ones are [here](https://github.com/dobromirmontauk/open-leadership-management-cookbook/tree/main/recipes/management/increasing_the_capacity_to_win/growing/expectations/ladders). You can use this to drive the interview process; share the ladder, discuss each expectation, and get a score. 

# Closing

The closing is a chance to “open up” the interview again. By this time you have dug deep into a lot of areas and hopefully are in the weeds. Time to zoom out again and see if you missed anything.

A couple of questions that accomplish this:

* Any questions I didn’t ask that I should have asked?  
* Anything else that you can tell me that would help X succeed at Mashgin?  
* \[my favorite\] Congratulations\! You are going on a 6-month sabbatical. What advice would you leave this person with? 

Most of the time you will get little in the closing, but perhaps 10% of the time something will come up that was missed in the rest of the interview – and you need to hear it.
