# ***QA Lead Scorecard***

*The QA Lead at <company> is responsible for ensuring that the Product Engineering team at <company> can efficiently release quality features to customers. This ensurance of quality is applied at multiple layers in the development process, but should always be implemented in a way that helps empower Engineers to deliver quality features faster.*  
*The two most critical things on the QA Lead's mind at all times should be 1\) ensuring that the products being delivered can be successfully used by customers and 2\) ensuring that the quality practices are an aid in helping engineers deliver quality products more raplidly.*

## ***How to use this scorecard***

*To get the most out of this document you should score yourself on each item, and give yourself a min/max/average on each dimension. Then, ask your manager to do the same \- and maybe peers too. See if they grade you close to how you grade yourself. The goal is to help you go through the [learning cycle](https://web.archive.org/web/20180817212310/http://www.cala.fsu.edu/modules/assessing\_knowledge): ignorance → declarative → procedural → mastery.*  
*Make a copy of this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PX61irzc6eCxgl2tzEzE6aKF92l7EoHcVac7Nb1Beko/edit\#gid=0) and use the following rating scale:*

* *1 \- You’re not doing this and aren’t likely to in the future.*  
* *2 \- You have significant areas where you need to improve.*  
* *3 \- You do this well.*  
* *4 \- You do this amazingly — keep it up.*  
* *5 \- OMG how do you do this so well???*

  ## ***How your manager judges you:***

1. *Quality: Quality you can taste®*  
   1. *You ensure that work released to production is error-free and you are obsessed with ensuring quality, measured by reducing the Defect Escape Ratio. This means catching bugs in the QA process before they become defects in production.*  
   2. *You are thorough in thinking through test cases and user scenarios, seeing what everyone else on the team may miss.*  
   3. *You consider risk factors and effectively prioritize test efforts accordingly.*  
   4. *You use data and metrics to measure the effectiveness of testing efforts and optimize efforts to improve over time.*  
   5. *You inspire other engineers on your team to have a higher quality bar by working with them to develop a testing plan early in the development cycle.*  
2. *Expertise: you are the undisputed expert on the product*  
   1. *You understand how the product works and should work and the nuances of design tradeoffs taken historically. You understand the inputs and outputs. You can reason through complex scenarios to predict how the product will behave.*  
   2. *You are aware of every change going into the product and ensure that quality is covered on every change (delegation is encouraged\!).*  
   3. *You have a 6+ month plan of how you want testing processes and systems to evolve.*  
   4. *You understand all the metrics that matter for the product and you regularly ask insightful questions and find surprising answers.*  
   5. *You use your expertise proactively to help the organization improve designs and avoid expensive mistakes.*  
3. *Team: you raise the bar in a high-performing team and continually improve it*  
   1. *You realize it's not about you. You put the team first in everything you do and your focus is on empowering others.*  
   2. *You are an amazing teacher. Instead of just doing testing yourself you empower engineers to test their own work effectively.*  
   3. *You can go on vacation and the team continues on effectively, relying on the solid practices and principles that you've helped put in place.*  
   4. *Product Managers, Designers, and Engineers alike all love working with you because your work helps them be successful.*  
   5. *You are an effective partner to your EM for building a tribe: the team has fun, loves what they do, and may be friends forever.*  
4. *Execution/Process: you keep the team executing at peak-performance with minimal (but not too little\!) process*  
   1. *You are actively working with engineers to automate as much of the QA process as possible.*  
   2. *You enact the right amount of process to keep engineers fully utilized, stakeholders informed, customers happy, risks identified, and commitments met.*  
   3. *Your work helps maximize the overall throughput of the engineering team. Engineering time is sacred to you and you don't waste it needlessly. You understand what work needs to be done and the relative importance of everything in the backlog.*  
   4. *You make visible progress on multi-quarter goals on a monthly basis, monthly goals on a weekly basis, weekly goals on a daily basis...*  
   5. *You're happy to wear hats that are missing in your team/organization. Where needed you can jump in as a Scrum Master, Product Manager, etc. \-- temporarily...*  
5. *Customer Obsession: you understand your internal customer's needs deeply*  
   1. *You know who your customers are and you evangelize their problems, needs, and vocabulary within your team. All members understand the bigger picture and the role of your project/team within it.*  
   2. *You care about your customers. You make weekly, quarterly, and yearly commitments and regularly hit them.*  
   3. *You understand the problems of your customers better than they do. You regularly solve their problems preemptively.*  
   4. *You know when to accept technical debt for the sake of the customer and you advocate to pay it down at the right moment.*  
   5. *You escalate product requirements when they are unclear or not in the overall best interest of your customers/users.*  
6. *Leadership*  
   1. *You get buy-in from the engineers, EM/PM, and peers for your QA vision.*  
   2. *The other QA team members look up to you and learn from you. They love working with you and improving in their craft.*  
   3. *You manage up effectively. You are high signal-to-noise and escalate when appropriate: bad technical decisions, poor work quality, inappropriate workload, unreasonable technical debt, etc.*  
   4. *You maintain healthy peer relationships with all Engineers, especially Team Leads. You keep them aware of quality concerns and the technical challenges of the QA team, as well as your plans to deal with them.*  
   5. *You are always looking to evolve QA processes and systems in order to deliver the most effectively. You realize the current system will not be the best solution, forever, and that past decisions may be the wrong future direction. You don’t let ego or fear prevent you from catching the next wave: you jump in head-first, learn the implementation, technology, concepts, etc \- and teach your team to do the same.*

*Credits: thanks to …*

* *Will Truong for the [Gardener Engineering scorecard](https://github.com/wllmtrng/engineering-scorecards/blob/master/gardener\_scorecard.md) which was used as a guide for this scorecard. He thanked Dobromir Montauk for helping put together that scorecard, and to Wade Chambers whose VP of Engineering scorecard inspired him. A long line of wisdom.*

## **Interview Process:**

### Breadth (Quality Ownership, Expertise): (90 min)

# Objectives

From this interview, we want to establish:

* The candidate understands how to fully flesh out test scenarios, thinking through edge cases and how things may break in ways that most engineers may miss.   
* The candidate can collaborate on solving a problem, using test driven design (TDD) with another engineer.

As well, and no less importantly, we want to convince the candidate to work for <company> if the fit is right. We want to share interesting information to the extent we can, and get them thinking about how they could contribute. We want to give an impression of our interviewers as people who the candidate would like to work with.

We'd like to avoid false positives (hiring candidates who aren't the right fit), or candidates passing on our offers for reasons other than poor fit. The ideal outcomes here are that we decide the candidate is the right fit, make an offer, and they accept, or that we determine the candidate isn't the right fit and we part amicably, with them ready to apply at a later date, or say nice things about us to their friends and colleagues.

Take good notes in a confidential Google doc during the interview. Be prepared to make a case either in favor or against for a weekly batch of candidates on Friday. Use the batching process to calibrate your expectations.

# Setup

The candidate has been primed with the following message:

| You will be participating in a "breadth interview" with John Doe focusing on skills required for someone in the QA Lead role. This assessment is designed to evaluate your ability to navigate through a real-world testing scenario from start to finish. You will be required to demonstrate your proficiency in writing test cases using [BDD testing syntax](https://www.parasoft.com/blog/bdd-testing-framework-guide/) (Given/When/Then). You will be asked to screen share your whole screen. The session will span 1 hour and 30 minutes. Refresh yourself with unit testing, test driven development, and behavioral driven design, because the exercise can involve test planning in any of these areas. |
| :---- |

Bear this in mind in your evaluation. If the candidate does not have an IDE and interpreter setup and ready, consider rescheduling.

# Round 1 \- Introduction

Time: 5-10 minutes

You are about to interview a future coworker, someone who will be your peer if they get hired. It's important that the interview feels collaborative.

Spend somewhere in the range of 5-10 minutes getting to know this person, and opening a 2-way channel of communication. Unfortunately, there's no formula to follow here, but a good rule of thumb is that you should volunteer as much as they do here.

# Round 2 \- Relevant Testing Skills

## Description

Time: 70 minutes

The purpose of this round is to:

- [ ] Give the candidate some information about what we do. Remember, 2-way information channel.  
- [ ] Present a problem that is realistic to the actual work we do if possible, so the candidate feels they're being treated fairly.  
- [ ] Give the candidate a chance to show off their ability to speak about and understand technical subject matters, and collaborate in a role-play meeting scenario  
- [ ] Give the candidate a chance to show off their testing skills without introducing a testing framework into the mix  
      - [ ] Can the candidate effectively create functional requirements in collaboration with an engineer?  
      - [ ] Can the candidate effectively create testing scenarios?

Paste the following prompt into a shared Google doc **one section** at a time. Explain to the candidate in your own words how our system works. Spend \~10 minutes just explaining how things work, soliciting questions often.

## The prompt

You are given an in-progress Product Requirements Document for a new <company> feature being planned called Web Uploader:

*It may be appropriate to show the Web Uploader tool at beta.app.<company>.ai along with sharing the PRD.*

### Web Uploader Product Requirements Document

#### What

* Offer our customers an alternate option to upload scanned video files to <company>.  
* Allow users to access a web uploader via app.<company>.ai where they can upload video scans for <company> to consume.  
* Upon successful upload, the scanned files must go through the pipeline for processing.

####  User Problems

* Users have requested a “plug and play” option to upload scans to <company>.  
* Users do not want to have their iPhone tied up for hours while large files are being uploaded.  
* Users might have unreliable wifi connectivity.  
* Users may not want to use up a large portion of their phone storage for the copy/upload process.  
* Phone battery must be fully charged/charging for successful upload.

#### Why

Offering our customers an alternative option to upload files is the next step in allowing for true self service. While the app is a reliable method of conducting scans, as we scale to a large number of sites, it will be a wise move to offer customers a way to “plug and play” file transfers. We are currently sending customers equipment which consists of an iphone, camera and supporting hardware. The idea behind providing an iphone is that we are able to control the constraints which allow for a successful capture and upload process \- for eg, the phone is required to have adequate storage and battery without which the upload process might fail. When customers start purchasing their own equipment, we are unable to guarantee that these requirements will be met. By providing a web uploader that’s always available on app.<company>.ai, users will have the option of transferring files via their computer at any time.

#### KPIs

This feature should be adopted by 10% of customers in the performance plan after 90 days. We expect to improve the on-boarding completion rate by 50% within 60 days*.*

#### Product Requirements

* Allow a user to upload multiple files via [app.<company>.ai](http://app.<company>.ai/) to a GCS bucket for processing.  
* Upon selecting the desired files, the project name, floor, and section data should be captured automatically.  
* An uploaded video should have project, section, and floor information present in the video file metadata.  
* A user should be able to pause uploads that are in progress.  
* A user should be able to resume paused uploads.  
* A user should be able to cancel uploads in progress.  
* A failed upload should automatically retry, up to 3 times.  
* Upon successful upload, a success notification should be displayed.  
* When an upload fails, a failure notification should be displayed.

### Exercise 1: Flesh out the Functional Requirements (40 min)

The candidate should work with the interviewing Engineer to discuss the product requirements and create (write out) a list of functional requirements. The functional requirements listed should be much more exhaustive than the product requirements \- it should include everything needed in order to support the product requirements.

This should truly be a collaborative exercise, knowing that the Engineer is the expert on how the system currently works. The candidate should bring their unique QA perspective to identify functional gaps and fully break down the system to understand how each piece should work.

Example Output:

1. File Upload Functionality:  
   * The application should provide a feature to upload multiple files via app.<company>.ai interface.  
   * Users should be able to select multiple files from their local storage for uploading.  
2. Video File Metadata:  
   * When uploading a video file, the system should extract and store project, section, and floor information from the video file metadata.  
3. Pause, Resume, and Cancel Uploads:  
   * Users should have the ability to pause uploads that are in progress.  
   * Users should be able to resume paused uploads from the point of interruption.  
   * Users should have the option to cancel uploads that are in progress.  
4. Upload Retry Mechanism:  
   * In case of a failed upload, the system should automatically initiate up to 3 retries for the failed upload.  
5. Notification System:  
   * Upon successful upload of files, a success notification should be displayed to the user.  
   * If an upload fails, the system should display a failure notification to the user.  
6. Error Handling:  
   * In the event of any errors during the upload process (e.g., network issues, server errors), appropriate error messages should be displayed to the user, guiding them on how to proceed.  
7. Upload Progress Indicator:  
   * Users should be provided with a visual indicator showing the progress of their uploads, including the number of files uploaded and the total size of data transferred.  
8. Security Measures:  
   * Ensure secure transmission of files to the GCS bucket, implementing appropriate encryption protocols.  
   * Implement access controls to restrict unauthorized access to uploaded files and user data.  
9. Compatibility and Scalability:  
   * Design the system to handle a large number of concurrent uploads efficiently, ensuring scalability as the user base grows.  
10. Logging and Monitoring:  
    * Implement logging functionality to track upload activities, including successful uploads, failures, retries, and user interactions.  
    * Set up monitoring tools to continuously monitor the upload process and system health, enabling proactive identification and resolution of any issues.

#### Evaluation criteria

- [ ] Did the candidate effectively collaborate with the Engineer when building out functional requirements? They should not be trying to figure everything out themselves.  
- [ ] Did the candidate identify potential issues and functional gaps on their own?  
      *Examples:*   
      *\* Though multiple files may be uploaded, should they be uploaded simultaneously or one at a time?*  
      *\* Should the failure notification be displayed after the upload can no longer be retried or after the first failure?*  
- [ ] Is the technical requirements list exhaustive? Did the candidate go deep to make sure that edge cases were considered?

### Exercise 2: Build out the test cases for the Web Uploader Feature (30 min)

Using the functional requirements as a guide, the candidate should write out BDD test cases using Gherkin (or similar) syntax (given/when/then).

The cases should capture every functional requirement such that if all tests were run we could be confident that we have a working feature.

Example Output:

Feature: Video Upload to GCS Bucket

  Scenario: User uploads multiple files via app.<company>.ai  
    Given the user is logged in to the app.<company>.ai platform  
    When the user navigates to the file upload section  
    And selects multiple files for upload  
    Then the selected files should be displayed for verification

  Scenario: Extraction of metadata from video files  
    Given the user selects a video file for upload  
    Then the system should extract and display project, floor, and section information from the video file metadata

  Scenario: User pauses an upload in progress  
    Given an upload is in progress  
    When the user chooses to pause the upload  
    Then the upload process should halt, and a pause confirmation should be displayed

  Scenario: User resumes a paused upload  
    Given an upload is paused  
    When the user chooses to resume the paused upload  
    Then the upload process should resume from the point of interruption

  Scenario: User cancels an upload in progress  
    Given an upload is in progress  
    When the user chooses to cancel the upload  
    Then the upload process should be terminated, and a cancellation confirmation should be displayed

  Scenario: Automatic retry of failed uploads  
    Given an upload fails due to a network issue  
    When the system initiates a retry  
    Then the failed upload should be retried up to 3 times

  Scenario: Successful upload notification  
    Given files are successfully uploaded to the GCS bucket  
    Then a success notification should be displayed to the user

  Scenario: Failure notification for unsuccessful uploads  
    Given an upload fails due to an error  
    Then a failure notification should be displayed to the user

  Scenario: Error handling for upload process  
    Given the upload process encounters an error  
    Then an appropriate error message should be displayed to guide the user on how to proceed

  Scenario: Progress indicator for upload process  
    Given files are being uploaded  
    Then a progress indicator should be displayed, showing the number of files uploaded and the total size transferred

  Scenario: Secure transmission and access control  
    Given files are uploaded to the GCS bucket  
    Then ensure secure transmission using encryption protocols  
    And implement access controls to restrict unauthorized access to uploaded files and user data

#### Evaluation criteria

- [ ] Did the candidate take the functional requirements that they specified and fully cover it with test cases?  
- [ ] Did the candidate expand on edge cases while they were writing test cases?  
- [ ] Did the candidate write clear test cases that were easy to understand?  
- [ ] Did the candidate consider how to best consolidate or group tests to minimize the total testing footprint needed?  
- [ ] Are the scenarios written in a way where non-technical stakeholders can understand what the feature does?

## General Evaluation criteria

- [ ] Did the candidate ask good questions to clarify unclear points?  
- [ ] Was the candidate articulate and clear when communicating?  
- [ ] Was the candidate abrasive, arrogant, or dismissive at any point during the exercise?

# Round 3 \- Q\&A

Time: 10-15 minutes

Give the candidate time to ask whatever questions they would like. Pay attention to their level of curiosity and what kinds of questions they ask. A red flag would be someone who has few or no questions.

### Depth (Quality Ownership, Expertise, Process Improvement): (60 min)

* **Q: Can you tell me about a time in your career where quality at your company was struggling. What were the symptom(s)? What were the underlying problem(s)? What changes did you make? How did you decide what changes to make? Who did you work with to implement changes? What was the resulting impact? (15 min)**  
  * **QA Lead Qualifications**:  
    * Has very clear understanding of what was broken in their example and can clearly explain why.  
    * Took ownership of the situation and created processes (bonus points if automated) to improve the situation. This could be things like introducing new layers or types of testing, consolidating tests to align more closely with the user experience, changing the way in which QA works with Engineers in the SCRUM process, etc.  
    * Both the symptoms and resulting impact should be measurable. We want evidence that the QA Lead relies on data for their understanding, not just anecdotal evidence.  
  * **Bad answer**:  
    * Inability to come up with a good example.  
    * Lack of change.  
    * Lack of measurability.  
* **Q: What’s something you have worked on that’s lived longer than your involvement in it? What best practices do you believe led to its robustness, resiliency, and reliability? (15 min)**  
  * **QA Lead Qualifications**  
    * Story includes best practices like:  
      * Early QA involvement in the product development cycle (working alongside Product and Engineers, not just testing things downstream).  
      * Understanding the value of manual testing.  
      * Multiple layers of QA testing, with clear reasoning for what each layer contributed to the overall testing strategy.  
        * Feature testing (testing features prior to merge for release eligibility)  
        * Regression testing (testing the overall product prior to release)  
        * Smoke testing (testing released features and business critical features in production)  
      * Automated testing such as unit testing, integration testing, and E2E testing with clear reasoning for when to automate (once requirements are stable).  
      * Clear release process with testing at the center of it.  
  * **Bad Answer**  
    * Examples where software lived long past the candidate’s involvement due to circumstance. (Old/Legacy)  
    * Adding end to end testing for everything in a way where it makes testing slow.  
    * Not understanding the value of automated vs manual testing.  
* **Q: If you were building a QA and release process from scratch, describe the steps that should be in that process (using a diagram tool could help with this) (15 min)**  
  * **QA Lead Qualifications**  
    * Process should have testing at multiple layers, both for features and for releases.  
    * Release process should have clear checks and balances to make sure that working features are delivered as rapidly as possible.  
    * QA involvement should occur early in the development cycle so that engineers have testing in mind as they build the feature.  
    * As much automation as possible.  
  * **Bad Answer**  
    * Limited testing.  
    * Over-reliance on manual processes.  
    * QA focuses on regression testing to the detriment of involvement in the early part of the development cycle (we already have this).  
* Q\&A with you (15 min)

### PM Session (Quality Ownership, Customer Obsession, Team Collaboration): (60 min)

* **Q: Explain to me the last product you worked on. Why was it important to your customers and your business? (15 min)**  
  * **QA Lead Qualifications**: we are looking for someone who can tie their product all the way back up to company strategy and deep customer needs. Keep digging with “why” questions until you feel you wouldn’t be able to get a better answer from the CEO of that company\! If you come out understanding why the company exists, how are they accomplishing the why, and what specifically are they doing to solve the how, then this question has been answered 100%.   
  * **Bad answer**: candidate is very tactically-focused. “We were told to build this”, “the customer asked for that”... They confuse launching features as impact. They have trouble explaining how they partner with other functions or it feels very much a “throw it over the wall” partnership.   
* **Q: In what capacity did you help your team in understanding the customer and the product? (5 min)**  
  * **QA Lead Qualifications:** Not only can this person translate what is important to the customer, but they have had experience of translating what’s important to the customer into functional and non-functional requirements, supplementary to the first pass of product requirements defined by the product manager.  
* **Q: Walk me through how you believe a PM and QA Lead should work together. What are the touch points and areas of responsibility for each? (10 min)**  
  * **QA Lead Qualifications:** This person understands that the working relationship with the PM is vital for the health of the team. They are looking to offload detailed thinking from the PM so that they can own the quality of the product from planning through production. They are looking to improve the way in which Product and Engineering work together and striving to fill the gaps.  
  * **Bad answer**: Candidate is looking to be told what to do and not interested in planning upcoming work.  
* **Q**: **Walk me through a scenario where you disagreed with a PM. What was the disagreement and how did you reach a conclusion? (10 min)**  
  * **QA Lead Qualifications:** we’re looking for IC’s that can both up-level PM thinking and be receptive to feedback/influence to change their own thinking. Ideally they should have several stories that very concretely show how they changed a PMs mind (and resulted in a better product) and how they were wrong about something and reached a better end-state with PM’s help.  
  * **Bad answer:** Identified scenarios where they weren’t able to successfully convince the PM and let bad outcomes happen. Told you so mentality.  
* Q\&A with you (15 min)

### Topgrading (Leadership, Team Collaboration): (90 min)
