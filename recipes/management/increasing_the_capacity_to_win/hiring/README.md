# Introduction 
I love hiring. It might be my favorite activity as a HoE. It's the best way to correct all those mistakes I made the last time I went on a hiring spree...

More seriously... Hiring is often the second thing your CEO judges you on, after delivering software. That's because a lot of what you are doing behind the scenes becomes "real" when you try to hire people. Your ability to land great candidates is a lagging indicator on doing a lot of other things right.
    * Do you have a good culture? Candidates can smell this.
    * Do you have a great team? Candidates get to meet many of them.
    * Is leadership aligned & transparent? Candidates will notice if they are not.
    * Does your product + business strategy make sense? Bad ones will scare off great people.
    * Does your technical strategy hold water? No plan --> no great people.
    * Are you able to causally grow your people? Will they be exploited and thrown away? Are you clueless what "growth" means beyond giving people bigger titles and more pay?

So... hiring starts way, way before your first interview. But, you didn't come to this section to hear about that; you came to hear some specific recipes that will let you land great candidates who solve all your problems without having to really do any hard work yourself. You're in luck! We have quite a few of those in here. Somewhere...

Hiring is a deep, deep topic, with a lot of excellent material out there, so if you are new to the field you should start with the following two books BEFORE diving into these recipes:
1. [Holloway Guide to Technical Recruiting and Hiring](https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about): an excellent soup-to-nuts, Undergrad 101 introduction to the subject. This should get you familiar with the lingo & baseline approaches. Follow this guide and you will get to "good". 
1. [Who: The A Method for Hiring](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Method-Hiring-Geoff-Smart-ebook/dp/B001EL6RWY/): the Grad 201 course. You might love it or hate it; it might the magic formula that makes you 'great' or snake oil 



if there are only two ways to measure "winning" as a Head of Engineering, it's (a) delivering product and (b) hiring great people. Kind of a "macro" version of winning + increasing the capacity to win.

* Topgrading
    * Curiousity --> pulling on the thread until you unroll it all. 
        * Examples??
    * Readback
        * Feedback for the candidate --> see how they respond
        * Feedback for you: how well did you do? Your 'integration test'
        * Attract: "how YOU will grow HERE"
    * CTO Parag hated my topgrading :)
* Training
    * Wade's hiring docs
* Engineering strength
    * A-players
    * B-players OK for non-critical systems
    * C-players pull you backwards (net-negative)
    * D- and below will get you fired.
* Candidate types
    * Trawling vs whale hunting
    * "Tracer round" candidates for calibration purposes
    * 
* Relationship with your recruiter (team).
    * Many HM don't invest in this. Beware the consequences.
    * To be excited about the roles, and show candidates the excitement, and close candidates, they need to *know* why. That's your job.
* Hiring wisdom
    * If the decision hinges on the numbers, you've already lost. (Delaney)
    * "I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." -> Maya Angelou . You make people feel during the interview process is CRITICAL.
        * Are you making them feel important or unimportant? Valued or unvalued? A cog in the machine or the next MVP?
