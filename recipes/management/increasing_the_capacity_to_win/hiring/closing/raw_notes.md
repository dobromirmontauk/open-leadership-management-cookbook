## Closing Candidates



* 5 Phases of Closing
    * Opening: Awareness (“one of many”)
    * Beginning: Consideration (“one of few”)
    * Middle: Evaluation (“worth my time”)
    * End: Justification (“I should say YES because…”)
    * Close: Hit the BUY button (“Remove all these blockers…”)
    * YES, closing begins in the opening :)

* Throughout the process
    * Understand why they might say NO → and crush the FEAR
        * We should be saying NO to 90% of candidates - we reserve that right. Candidates should almost NEVER say NO to us!
        * Candidates are afraid… Of what?
            * The company: startups are risky. What will my parents say?
            * The manager: most are average,  many suck. Who am I getting?
            * The job: overpromise, under-deliver. Not that interesting, not what you claim it is, etc etc.
            * The team: “everyone is great.” → but most teams are average!
            * The growth: “will I learn anything, or just be exploited?”
            * The impact: “will my work MATTER?”
            * The OPPORTUNITY COST: is this really 2x better than what I have now, or others I’m talking to?
    * Understand why they will say YES → and cut them, or use it!
        * What is their internal prioritization function? Most people **don’t know themselves.** You need to help them figure this out - and it helps you too.
        * They should be saying YES to our unique set of challenges, not to the “good stuff.” Everyone will say YES to money, hard technical problems, great team mates, etc etc. That is not interesting. Will they be ATTRACTED or SCARED by our warts?
        *  The thing that is HARD for us should be what gets them excited. 
            * What are the biggest problems on your team? At the company? With the tech? Where are we behind? 
            * If sharing this scares them, GOOD. If it attracts them, GOOD.
        * Being transparent with the problems also build credibility; see below.
* Rational vs Emotional
    * There’s emotion at every step in the process, but there isn’t much “connection” yet - so you may not be able to tap into it.
    * You START with more credibility, and you have less the further you go - because you are more invested in the outcome. Use that knowledge: set the framework that they should use, how to think about us, etc. If you can influence their thought process here, you can use it later. You can’t change the way they think later on.
    * The deeper the candidate is in your funnel, the closer a relationship you will have. Emotions play a much larger part. People want to belong, they want to be seen for who they are, they want to know they will win.

* The Interview Process roughly follows the buying funnel
    * **Opening: Awareness (“one of many”)**
        * Recruiter Call (sometimes HM, for whales)
    * **Beginning: Consideration (“one of few”)**
        * HM call (or 2nd HM call / “coffee chat”)
    * **Middle: Evaluation (“worth my time”)**
        * by end of PS
        * Sometimes not needed if Recruiter/HM pitch is strong. You probably still shouldn’t skip the PS step because of the additional touch-point/momentum building. 
    * **End: Justification (“I should say YES because…” instead of “I should say NO because…”)**
        * By the end of OS, ideally. Requires VERY trained interviewers.
        * Often goes into TG, with untrained interviewers. This is a sign you need to train your team to ABS. 
    * **Close: Hit the BUY button (“Remove all these blockers…”)**
        * by the end of TG, ideally. Emotional connection to the candidate is built, they have a picture of why they will UNIQUELY win at Doxel and why this is the right career step for them.
        * This requires a very well-honed TG game. Expect ~dozens of TG before you can do this, and even then, maybe a 50% hit rate...
        * Often requires ~multiple post-TG conversations to uncover the REAL blockers (and remove them). Easy conversations (e.g. with recruiter) are a sign TG is working. Large conversations (existential) suggest TG rewiring.
* How you INFLUENCE (i.e. “sell”) **changes during the process.**
    * You can influence three things: which internal **model** (“how they think”) they apply, which **features** (“what they focus on”) they feed into the model (to grossly overuse ML concepts), and the **emotional** (“how they feel”, related to model/features but different). 
    * The deeper the candidate is in your funnel, the more tied you are to the outcome → you become less & less credible. So you **cannot** change how they think (i.e their model) later in the process. 
    * Model 
        * How to think about their career
        * How to think about their risk/reward comfort
            * And what is the **real risk**? Opportunity cost > explicit outcomes!
        * How to think about what is **actually** important to them (vs what they say). Team? Comp? Work? Fun? 
        * What does a “great company” smell like?
        * What does a “great team” smell like?
        * What **features** they should be paying attention to going through this process - and what they shouldn’t. I.e. paint them a roadmap of what they will see about Doxel. 
        * Be open about the “bad” -- what might be “bad” for some people is “good” for others → that’s how you get a great fit
            * E.g. chaos, lack of support, too much work, … → what is the positive version of these?
        * Etc etc
    * Features
        * The deeper in the funnel, the less the **features come from you**. They need to come from “independent” sources.
        * Show them, don’t tell them.
        * Engineers on the team are your best source of features.
        * 2nd parties can be helpful (Khoi, Erik, me - less “tied to the outcome”) → expertise is credible! [PM, HR, investors…] 
        * Any information on the website, LinkedIn, GlassDoor…
    * Emotional
        * The deeper in the funnel, the **more the emotional comes from you**. They need to feel like you are their **advocate** and will make them **win** if they join the company.
* How do you influence their MODEL? Short version: WISDOM.
    * General principles. How will they make decisions?
    * Challenge them. DON’T actively sell them. E.g. challenges: 
        * EXERCISE: let’s discuss how to challenge a candidate?
    * Be yourself, 100% - you are looking for people who are ATTRACTED to the raw version of you + Doxel. They are ATTRACTED to the challenge!
    * Be memorable. They are talking to dozens of companies and managers. How will you stand out?
    * Be confident. Not fake-confidence - true, “I know what I know, I know what I don’t know” confidence. 
        * (DON’T be an asshole about it!!) 
* How do you influence their FEATURES? Short version: PLANNING + TRAINING
    * What features do you need to show them? Pick the right interview panel, the right interview process (format + questions), the right closing process (what data we show). 
    * You have to train your interviewers, and know what they are / are not capable of!
    * Examples
        * On one team, scared off multiple EM candidates by having engineers go too deep into coding → sent a message of “this is what we expect from you.”
        * Diversity signals.
            * Don’t ignore this.
        * Cultural signals. 
            * This is why 2 people in an interview can be powerful: showing them how our people **talk to each other**.
        * Project signals → how can we represent the work we do at Doxel within our interviews?
*  How do you influence their EMOTIONS?
    * Make it personal, once you understand their internal model. You CONTINUE with tying rational to emotional. Draw them a picture of the future! [Topgrading] 
        * Why will THEY win here?
        * How will THEY grow here?
        * How will THEY benefit from Doxel’s growth?
        * Why is this a UNIQUE opportunity for them? 
        * Don’t tell them… Show them. 
    * You END with the emotional pull
        * Why should they work for YOU?
        * How will YOU bet on them?
        * How will YOU grow them?
        * How will YOU help them win?
* NOT YET ORGANIZED
* HM/recruiter call
    * AFFINITY is the name of the game. This will be a near-spontaneous reaction, on both sides.
        * The easy thing to do is say “hmm, no strong reason to say no… so I will move them along.” This is the WRONG thing to do. If you are not excited about them - or see the _potential_ to be excited - cut them, or keep them in this part of the process. 
        * If they aren’t excited about us, you probably shouldn’t be excited about them ;)
        * There are a LOT of candidates out there… Really. Really, really. Hard to remember sometimes. But remembering this will help you feel more comfortable cutting “good” candidates.
        * A bad hire is 10x worse than no hire. Really. They cost us $$$ and don’t deliver the impact we need. And they eat up your time, both in hiring and managing later. Don’t fall into this temptation - I’ve done it many times, and always regretted it.
    * Give them the agenda - but let them control it.
        * “I’d like to cover three things today: an overview of Doxel and our business, a deep dive into our technology and product, and a deep dive into your background, interests, and possible futures. Happy to do that in any order: what would you like to start with?”
        * This gives them predictability AND makes you look confident. 
    * Aim to cut ~50% of candidates.
        * &lt;50%? You should be talking to more people - or be more selective in your criteria.
        * >50%? Work with your recruiter/sourcer to dial-in stronger candidates. 
    * How not to confuse it with confirmation bias?
* PS
    * TODO
* Onsite interviews
    * TODO
* TG call
    * TODO
* Sell call(s)
    * TODO
* Close call
    * TODO
* MISC
    * When in doubt, ask them :) Probably nobody ever has!


## Raw Notes from John		



* Closing signs
        * Biggest fear a candidate is going to have?
            * “Am I fucking up? Is this a mistake?” → people have different motivations.
        * Fit narrative: you are tied to the outcome. Spectrum of credibility, timeline of credibility. Inversely proportional.
        * Quality narrative: intros → offers. I’ve hit ⅛ - how does it fit into “fit” narrative?
        * Signal-to-noise. Startup fatigue. Am I fucking up looking at this? Am I fucking up ignoring this?
        * AFFINITY: near spontaneous reaction. 
            * How do you not confuse it with confirmation bias? 
            * If you see really slow starting candidates, cold, hard to open up… Makes it hard to hire.
            * You need recruiters who can “click”. Managers need to “click”. Basic building block.
            * My rule: “we are the ones who say no. Not you.” No one says NO except us. We are greedy on paper.
            * Ignorance breeds confidence. “You don’t know enough to say no. You think you do, but you don’t know enough about us.” 
            * Cut maybe ~50%, never ignore gut feel.
        * How do you get to affinity?
            * “What do we really, really value in our engineers?” 
            * Either they exhibit it, or you test them - see if it resonates.
            * “Potential for alignment”
            * What is important to the candidate? They tell you the safe things. “They will say no if these things are true - but they won’t say YES if these things are true.”
    * How do you train on AFFINITY?
        * HMs have to believe this matters.
            * The way they want to do it is SAFE. Easier to say yes and push them through. 
            * If you have 9 hours to cut down a tree… spend 6 sharpening your axe.
            * Don’t push things through the sausage maker. How do you get better at it? 
            * The earlier you can figure things out, the more control you have later. Less credibility later. Then there is more selling.
            * Meaningful conversation about your career. CANNOT HAPPEN at the end! E.g. hiring is a concert. It crescendoes - gets louder & louder as it progresses. When are you going to give them the best advice? At the end - when everyone is maxing the volume - you will not be heard.
            * 
        * BIGGEST FEAR: needs to be crushed on the first call.
        * NO IF vs the YES IF. Why are they going to say YES?
    * Behind the scenes as a recruiter, selling.
        * Transaction: exchange of goods & services for the money.
            * We are not a diner. 
        * Negotiation: show the benefit. 
        * Process-oriented selling. Beneficial stuff at the end. 
        * Try not to get them to say “no” too early. 
    * EXERCISE:
        * Who are you going to say NO to in your first call?
        * Who are you going to get EXCITED ABOUT in your first call?
        * What are the patterns that match AFFINITY?
            * They should be guessing WHAT IS NEXT for the company!
            * Doesn’t have to be right, just shows that they are 
        * How is Doxel UNIQUE to them? What type of person NEEDS to be here?
        * What is the job UNIQUE to them? Why would a top performer want to take this job? 
            * David and Goliath problem. Find your David’s - where they see the problem as easy where we see it as hard.
            * “I know I can win” → “I’ll look as hero”
            * Paint the battle, the real David will emerge. 
        * How do you CHALLENGE them and get GROWTH MINDSET?
        * How do you work towards a STRONG YES or a STRONG NO
        * How do you show you SINCERELY CARE? Psychological security - people are worried “am I fucking up?” They need to feel safe making this decision. 
        * FIRST CALL
    * Give them the building blocks of the call. 
    * This gives you confidence but them the power.
    * Let them decide how do they want to run it. It’s about them.
* Misc
    * Covariation model. Attribution model? 
    * Individual thought or consensus-driven thought. 


## Erik



* Disagree!
    * First part is emotional: “i’m a nice guy, you’re a nice guy, let’s be nice guys together.”
    * First part is not fear, it is discovery. 
    * You start emotional, build credibility. You give them a roadmap. “My team is great, here is what you might be afraid.”
        * Give them the problems so they can go find them.
        * Help them SEE what you SAY.
    * Funnel depth doesn’t matter for emotional connection, it is frequency of and depth of connection.
    * 

## Chan conversation 3/26/24
* How is she choosing between companies?
    * She has a rough idea in her head how to choose companies, but she's not completely sure yet...
    * There are a fixed set of ways people choose. 
        * John's criteria: "Grow Me", "Pay Me", "Comfort Me"
        * My slightly more expanded version:
            * Manager
            * Team
            * "coolness"
            * Mission
            * Founders
            * Money
            * Equity / potential upside
            * Role / opportunity
            * Technical challenge
            * Impact to world
    * Need a guide to how people choose and how to navigate this.
        * Mashgin example -- Michael + Akshay both declining their offers.
        * Michael: 'the startup is overvalued' after talking to his analytical wife; 'spreadsheet decision making'. Devin saying "we don't look at that, we want people who want to build cool stuff."
        * Akshay: being paid Google $$$. Pressure testing this early on.
* How do you choose between so-so manager/good company and great manager/so-so company?
    * False choice?
*
