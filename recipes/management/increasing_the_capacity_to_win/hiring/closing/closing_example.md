Hey REDACTED,

[CEO] shared some of the exchanges with you and asked that I check-in. I’ve been thinking about the situation and
here’s what I’ve got. Apologies if this comes across harshly; I’m purely trying to help, and I can share a story where I
received a similar kick-in-the-butt from Wade if you’d like - it was pivotal in my career so I’m hoping I can do the
same for you.

You don’t get to “check back”. You have all the information you need to say YES or to say NO. Either is completely fine!
But it is unacceptable for a senior leader, at this stage in the decision cycle, to say “keep the door open for me while
I go check other options…” Leadership, at the level we’d like to hire you into, is all about confidently working in
ambiguity where you cannot get all the information on the table. You do a reasonable amount of diligence and then you
commit to the course. Leaders need to be able to sleep at night with decisions that make or break individuals, teams,
and companies - and never know if they made the right call. This step in the process is literally confirming if you’re
ready for this type of role.

You told [CEO] “I wanted to attain peace”. That desire, in itself, is a bottleneck in your ability to become the next
version of yourself. You have good judgement and I’m really worried you’re not trusting it. You’re avoiding both the YES
and NO hard decisions by retreating to your competence: an analytical position (“let’s get more data…”)! This approach
has probably served you well as a technical lead on small teams where you’re an expert. It becomes analysis paralysis
when you’re leading 20, 40, 100 engineers and your ability to make good technical decisions depends more on learning
whom to listen to, where to verify, and trusting your own judgement. And being OK with being wrong sometimes.

Sometimes to get to the next level you need to break the patterns that keep you down. This is that moment for you.

If you say YES today, then welcome on board and let’s do this. If you say NO today, I respect that is the best decision
for you and I look forward to a time in the future where we do get to work together. But if you say MAYBE, then this
leadership door is closed for the foreseeable future - even if the role remains open. I could still hire you as an IC
next month but leaders follow leaders stronger than themselves - and I want to put some strong leaders under you in the
next year. So go BURN THE SHIPS.

A one word response will do.

Dobromir
