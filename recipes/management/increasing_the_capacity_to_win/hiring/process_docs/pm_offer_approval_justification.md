## Justification (1-2 paragraph):

John has been a PM at Amazon for 3.5 years during which he has founded 2 products, REDACTED and REDACTED and publicly
launched them. In our interviews he came across as a very strong analytical thinker that can enter completely new
domains (e.g. X or Y), understand the domain quickly, and determine the best courses of action from first-principles. He
had good examples of how he spent months really digging into the X world, learning from experts, and slowly producing
his vision and execution for the product (ending up with a 55-page thesis over 80 iterations!).

His EECS background combined with his recent work in ML make him very well suited to building products that depend
heavily on ML/CV performance. Nobie and Arun believe he will work well with the engineering team in defining the product
based on engineering limitations. He has several years of experience doing customer development and product research
which will be helpful to us building a solid QA/QC offering.

Last but not least, his Amazon product culture will be a welcome addition to our team since they are famous for “working
backwards” and putting customers first.

We think he is in the **top range of a Sr. PM **and that our offer is somewhat competitive with his Amazon current comp
so we may be able to convince him based on our company growth story.

## Growth

Jane Foe, John’s engineering counterpart on the REDACTED project put it best:

    He needs to take something that is solid engineering and take it to market. I think it is too difficult for him to iterate on PRODUCT and ENGINEERING. 
    He needs something where the market is not too complicated, there is a product, and what you have to do is all the due-diligence that a TRUE PM needs
     to do. When you have to work backwards - "maybe there is a market here, what is the engineering we need to do?" - that would be too much for him.

This maps perfectly well to our Quality product and we can unlock his growth potential at [COMPANY] in this role.

John has asked if he can be exposed to “more of the business”. I pitched him taking over the Biz Dev work with REDACTED
as an example of something that could naturally end up in his court. My guess is he’d love to be close to sales,
marketing, etc as Product Owner for Quality. He’d probably also thrive to have a seat at the table to how Founders build
companies.

## Risks (1-2 paragraph):

John has no experience in enterprise software or construction. There will be a several month ramp-up before he
understands the GC/VDC space deeply. On REDACTED his reference said it took him 2-3 months to understand the domain
deeply.

Personality-wise, John likes to run fast and sometimes gets ahead of his team. In a role where he needs to collaborate
closely with Marketing and Sales he may need some coaching on pulling the team along with him and not doing their work
for them. In the beginning, this may be an asset as we are understaffed and he is able to wear multiple hats.

John has mentioned several times a career path to Director. It’s not clear he understands exactly what a more senior PM
might do, other than manage other PMs. I think he needs some coaching on a career path as an IC PM and the potential
impact at a company like [COMPANY], and also how a rocketship startup can launch his career over the next 2-4 years.

While John is only looking at startups right now he has not worked in one before. He doesn’t understand startup equity
and probably doesn’t have a good model on how to compare good vs bad startups. He seems to be valuing the face-value of
our equity and not the possible growth upside.

## [COMPANY] Core Virtues:

**Ownership**: 5 - great stories about handling marketing, sales, everything else in order to get a product out.

**Hunger/Decisiveness**: 4 - showed a hunger from learning Japanese all the way to perfecting his first camera and later
products. He’s not content just meeting goals; he always wanted to exceed.

**Humble**: 3 - he’s focused on accomplishments and growth and this leads him to be self-focused over team-focused. In
reference checks we will see if this is a bigger risk than noticed in the interview.

**Empathetic**: 4 - good story about coming in on the weekends with his eng team, even if he didn’t have to, to support
them for a launch.

**Intellectual Honesty**: 4 - was very honest in the interview but did not display quite enough tact to hit the
Exemplary bar. There is some risk he will rub people the wrong way by being too open.
