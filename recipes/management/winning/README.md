# Unorganized ðŸ“‹
* Metrics meetings
* Red/Yellow/Green
* Cycles
    * 
* Postmortems? Or do those go in #increasing?
* Staff Meeting
* Progress review meetings
    * Founder Reviews? 
* PRDs/TDDs/Sprint process?
* Big Decision meetings?
* Peer relationships
    * No matter what level you are, you can't succeed without your peers.
    * This becomes even more true as you go up the ranks! A VP of engineering is SO dependent on VP of Product, Ops, etc!
    * Does this go under Increasing Capacity or under Winning? 
    * Stories
        * Vic story about my Dir of Eng not getting along with his peers. "Not my job to teach him"
    

## What is winning??
* Building the *control loop* -- constantly readjusting the machinery to be moving in the right direction.
* Hitting goals.
    * Planning: setting the *right* goals
    * Execution: making expected progress to the goals
* Genuinely confused about this. What "feels like" winning in my role is increasing the capacity to win. Hiring a new QA Lead? I increased my team's capacity to win. Improving the On Call process? Increased TCTW. Sucessfully convincing a manager to ...? Increased TCTW? So what is *winning* proper??
    * Maybe the reason this feels confusing is because my job IS to increase the capacity to win, mainly. I'm not writing the code, running the standups, doing QA, etc anymore. IC vs EM job. So winning == increasing my team's capacity to win. Then there is also increasing MY capacity to win...?
    * Is there any winning OTHER than increasing the team's capacity to win?

    * Definition
    * Is delegation LEADERSHIP or MANAGAMENT?
* Examples of good vs bad delegation

        * 
* Why do we delegate?
* Delegation TASKS vs MISSIONS 
    * Autonomy/mastery/purpose
    * MIssions
        * Pain + gain need to be aligned. 
            * Example: Alignment verification?
            * 
* Vacuum delegation
    * When you are not sure who has the skill/will
* Delegating up

* Delegating to an team vs a person
    * Green m&m story
