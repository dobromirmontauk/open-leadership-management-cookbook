# What Are Ingredients?
In cooking, 'ingredients' are the raw materials that you combine using 'tools & techniques' via instructions in a 'recipe' to make a dish greater than the sum of its parts. 

In L&M the equivalent raw material is *knowledge*. Knowledge is the ability to identify, explain, and use patterns in our Universe (*editor: is using NOT knowledge, and skill instead? Need to think about this*). A great L&M mixes their vast knowledge in the perfect proportions for a given situation. Therefore to build mastery in L&M, one must continuously explore the world's knowldge. Building mastery requires a *deep curiosity about how the world works*. This might actually be a good way to help you decide if L&M is the right career path for you. Go through the categories of knowledge you'll need to explore below. Are you excited about diving deep in 10% of them? 50%? All of them? The 'higher' up the L&M hierarchy you want to go the more you'll need at least some level of awareness across this breadth of knowledge. Consider this as you make your career choices.

Note that the definition of _knowledge_ we are using avoids the limitation of "book knowledge". Let's examine empathy. Why do we feel empathetic towards others? It's because we notice some commonalities, some pattern, that binds us. Perhaps it's our shared struggles. Perhaps it's our bond as parents. Or perhaps it's just a vague feeling of humanity. In every case there is some _knowledge_ that underpins our behaviors, our emotions, our beliefs. Other words are sometimes used (mindset, values, ideas...) and may resonate more or less with you. That's great, feel free to translate our use of _knowledge_ for yourself. The idea matters more than the word.

Of course, some knowledge ends up being more relevant to Engineering Leadership & Management than other knowledge. (_I have yet to deploy what I learned about French film theory in college or how to safely lift a partner in Fusion dance in my professional life!_ --Dobromir). This part of our book provides a reference to the general categories of knowledge you should expect to dive into during your career. We'll provide a few levels of expansion when there are particularly relevant areas that should be known by everyone.

## Charlie Munger
While I've always been a big believer in a multidisciplary approach to work -- nay, to all of life, inspired by Heinkein's quote: "Specialization is for ants" -- I was never sure about how to justify this to engineering leaders who have mostly succeeded on their specialized knowledge.

Charlie Munger to the rescue. You might discard my opinion easily, but you are unlikely to discard his. Almanack.

MODELS OF THINKING. Different from knowledge. Hanging your facts on a theoretical structure that helps connect them together. 

## Organization

Read the Economist. 
Go to history museums. Understand the roots and effects of all major events in the last 100 years.

This layout is organized roughly like a University might arrange its departments because, by and large, Universities do have a good grasp of the sphere of knowledge and how to teach it. Each page will have the minimum concepts that you should be familiar with, almost a 'glossary & quiz' approach so you can test yourself. 101 + 201 depth, nothing more. Links to where you go get the actual concepts if the description isn't enough to satisfy you.

The only things you need to learn:
* Learn to Think.
   * The Professor.
   * Create Theoretical Frameworks
   * Math taught me this. How to *think logically*. 
   * Munger: "To this day, I have never taken any course, anywhere, in chemistry, economics, psychology, or business. But I early took elementary physics and math and paid enough attention to somehow assimilate the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science, which I thereafter pushed further and further into softer and softer fare as my organizing uide and filing system in a search for whatever multidisciplinary worldly wisdom it would be easy to get."
* Learn to Organize. 
   * Break down a problem into its components parts.
   * Dependency graph.
   * Estimate the work.
   * Assign risks.
* Learn to Debug
* Learn to Dream
   * The Artist. 
* Learn to Learn
   * Adding Facts to your Theoretical Framework

Organizational Physics
* These are the unviolatable laws that every organization succumbs to, like black holes gravity. Worth knowing because it explains some of the 'craziness' that is actually physics.
* E.g. Law of Less Communication. The bigger the org, the less people at the top communicate with people lower on the ladder. So each individual interaction is more meaningful to the people lower and less meaningful to the people higher.
   * Explains why ppl higher need to be more polished. That message benefits from being tight, not off-the-cuff.
   * Explains why ppl higher stay consistent. They won't remember what they told you b/c they are talking to so many differnet ppl -- unless they have very few messages they keep repeating.
   * Their opinion of you will be formed by what you say in just a few moments!
   * Trust equation: your credibility gets set by the promise you make...\
