# What Are Ingredients?
In cooking, 'ingredients' are the raw materials that you combine using 'tools & techniques' via instructions in a 'recipe' to make a dish greater than the sum of its parts. 

In L&M the equivalent raw material is *knowledge*. Knowledge is the ability to identify, explain, and use patterns in our Universe (*editor: is using NOT knowledge, and skill instead? Need to think about this*). A great L&M mixes their vast knowledge in the perfect proportions for a given situation. Therefore to build mastery in L&M, one must continuously explore the world's knowldge. Building mastery requires a *deep curiosity about how the world works*. This might actually be a good way to help you decide if L&M is the right career path for you. Go through the categories of knowledge you'll need to explore below. Are you excited about diving deep in 10% of them? 50%? All of them? The 'higher' up the L&M hierarchy you want to go the more you'll need at least some level of awareness across this breadth of knowledge. Consider this as you make your career choices.

Of course, some knowledge ends up being more relevant to Engineering Leadership & Management than other knowledge. I have yet to deploy my French film factoids in my professional life. This part of our book provides a reference to the general categories of knowledge you should expect to dive into during your career. We'll provide a few levels of expansion when there are particularly relevant areas that should be known by everyone.
