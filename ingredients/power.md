# What is Power?
The ability to change reality by a certain amount in a given amount of time. (I GOT THIS FROM SOMEWHERE -- what was the source??)

More power means you can change the world more, or in a smaller amount of time.

What does 'change the world' mean?
* In the end, it's literally the atoms of the universe. Moving them around. 
* Lots of steps to get there, e.g. Larry & Sergey had a ton of power, even though they weren't moving that many atoms ... because of what?
* Can you measure power (analytical) or is it computational? E.g. do you need to run the simulation to know what was powerful and what wasn't? How do I know that an idea has power and another one doesn't?
